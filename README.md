Hi! This is my first coding project.

As you can see, I used basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

I created this planner to learn basic front-end development, as well as create a simple planning space for busy students like myself.
This planner allows students to see all important tasks in one place without external clutter or distractions.

Please feel free to suggest any changes or improvements. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!
